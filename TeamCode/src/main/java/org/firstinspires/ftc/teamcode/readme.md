## FTC Team 14163 The Pitt Crew's Ultimate Goal code.
The most notable files here are the Odometry code and the use of it in the UltimateGoalRobot file.
The algorithms there have been proven to be very accurate if used properly, and they are pretty easy to use.

Feel free to plagiarize any code here for your use, especially if you're in an FTC team!
